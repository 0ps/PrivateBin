At first, awesome you take the time to make PrivateBin better! :tada: :+1:

Have a look at our [Contributing guide](Development) if you want to hack on the code.
If you want to translate PrivateBin into your language have a look at the [translation guide](Translation).

Except this also opening [issues](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/issues) helps much. Just describe your problem detailed enough and fill out our template.
